<h2>Top Three Movies</h2>
<hr></hr>
<h3>Fargo</h3>
<h4>Duh, it's Fargo. All time comfort movie, don't ya know.</h4>
<h3>Perfect Blue</h3>
<h4>
  Beautifully animated film. The story is really quite beautiful. It's really
  difficult to know whether the main character is truly going mad.
</h4>
<h3>Deliverance</h3>
<h4>
  Really good movie with a solid script and excellent acting. Way ahead of its
  time. Gender bending rape scene, with an atypical revenge sequence. Should
  have been a powerhouse film.
